# Allan Oricil

son of a cleaner and an ex factory employee.

## 2008 - Embraer's High School

Competed against 5,000 other low-income students, according to the local newspaper Vale do Paraiba, for 1 of 200 spots. I earned the 64th position.

## 2012 - Universidade Federal de Itajuba

- Computer Engineering 5th/60 using ENEM.
- GPA: 8.2 / 10 => 2nd or 3rd in my class considering overall grades.
- TA for OOP classes in C++ and Java, for two semesters, because I achieved the highest grades in those classes.
- I finished the course in 2017 as one of best students of my class, considering the gaussian curve made of grades.
- Studied in the USA, at UCCS in Colorado Springs, for a year. If I knew about Halo Effect, I wouldn't have gone there.
- Learned English on my own by playing games, and watching TV shows and movies.
- Stay away from this college, if you are a Brazilian, and a hard work student. Professors won't teach you anything that will make you employable. The reward/difficult is close to 0, if you know how the world works. Go to USP for engineering, or study abroad. Remember to use the Halo Effect in your favor.

## 2017

- Software Engineer.
- No career achievements.
- I was never promoted because I'm ugly and can't fake social skills.

## Goals

- leave Brazil and never come back. This country has no salvation.
- Work as a game developer in a big project.
- Create my own SaaS.
